# videoabstracts

Scripts for managing conference video abstracts.

### About

I wrote these scripts for creating packaged video abstracts for PLDI'15.   The general idea is that authors will submit videos (via some other system, such as a google form), and that these scripts will package the videos in a standard format with front and back matter to match the conference program.
